My first repository

Hello Github! 

Amin here! I am an award winning film director from London. I moved to Halmstad, Sweden and I started up my own creative agency called We Creatify. I have used Team Treehouse to learn front end development skills and coding in HTML, CSS and Javascript! I also plan to learn Ruby on Rails to make some great web applications.
